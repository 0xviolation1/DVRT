# Dynamic Value Relocation Table (DVRT) details

For the story that led us down the rabbit hole and straight to this post (not really, we took some detours), see [How Meltdown and Spectre haunt Anti-Cheat](haunted).

### How it's done
Retpoline changes are done ad-hoc when loading a kernel module to the memory in order to mitigate Spectre CPU vulnerabilities. Retpolines allow to replace an indirect call or jump with a sequence that has a safe speculation behavior. The question is how does the OS accomplish these changes -- how does it know where the replacements need to be applied? Where is all the information kept?

## DVRT
Dynamic Value Relocation Table (DVRT) is a metadata built into the binary during compilation phase. It's not a new format designed specifically for retpoline - it was introduced in the past, but the DVRT format was extended for the purpose of mitigating the Spectre v2. It is kept in the load config directory of the binary file.

DVRT format contains a lot of information, but for the sake of this article we will focus on just two fields:
```
uint32_t dynamicValueRelocTableOffset;
uint16_t dynamicValueRelocTableSection;
```

During the build, the compiler keeps all the metadata about indirect jumps/calls and stores them under
the `.reloc` section, repurposed for DVRT. At runtime, the kernel is parsing the DVRT data and applies
the retpoline patches for each reference kept there.
The retpoline can be enabled on OS level, using registry key `System\CurrentControlSet\Control\
Session Manager\Memory Management\FeatureSettings`. The flags responsible for retpoline are:
```
0x100 - FEATURE_SETTINGS_DISABLE_RETPOLINE
0x200 - FEATURE_SETTINGS_FORCE_ENABLE_RETPOLINE
```

The code of the retpoline sequences is stored in the `RETPOL` section of the kernel image. It is then
mapped to the page right after the end of the kernel module image (which means that this page is the
same for each image in the memory). All the replacements of the indirect calls and jumps will instead
refer to that page with retpolines -- which will execute the control flow in the way that is safe from
speculative execution attacks.

### Format
DVRT starts with the header:
```
struct ImageDynamicRelocationTable
{
    uint32_t version;
    uint32_t size;
};
```

Until now, there is only one version of the DVRT header (1). Size is of course number of bytes after the header that contains retpoline information. Then there are entries for each type of the retpoline (described further). Each block starts with the header:
```
struct ImageDynamicRelocation
{
    uint64_t symbol;
    uint32_t baseRelocSize;
};
```

Symbol field identifies one of the existing types of dynamic relocations so far (values 3, 4 and 5). Then, for each page, there is a block that starts with a relocation entry:
```
struct PEBaseRelocation
{
    uint32_t virtualAddress;
    uint32_t sizeOfBlock;
};
```

where `virtualAddress` is an address of the page for which the relocations need to be done, and
`sizeOfBlock` is size of all the entries for that page (in bytes).

After that there are entries for all of the places which need to be overwritten by the retpoline jump. The
structure used for those entries depends on the type (symbol) that was used above. There are three types
of retpoline so far. Entry for each of them will contain `pageRelativeOffset`. The kernel uses that entry to
apply the proper replacement under `virtualAddress + pageRelativeOffset` address. The rest of the
entry differs between the types of retpoline. Each of them is described below.
 
## Type 5 retpoline:
Structure:
```
union ImageSwitchtableBranchDynamicRelocation
{
    struct Parts
    {
        uint16_t pageRelativeOffset : 12;
        uint16_t registerNumber : 4;
    };
    Parts asParts;
    uint16_t asNumber;
};
```

This type is used for the indirect jumps for which the argument is put in one of the registers. The format
of the instructions for which this type applies is one of:
```
ff(e0-e7)    jmp rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rsi, rdi, rbp, rsp
41ff(e0-e7)  jmp r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15
```
depending on the number of the register. After applying the retpoline, the modified code will look like
this:
```
e9(xxxxxxxx)    jmp <address of the retpoline page + 0xA0 + 0x20 * registerNumber>
```
Address (calculated on runtime while loading the image) will refer to the retpoline for that case. At the
retpoline page (which is the next page after the image ends), under the offset 0xA0 there is a 0x20 entry
for each of the registers -- with the proper retpoline code.

## Type 4 retpoline:
Structure:
```
union ImageIndirControlTransferDynamicRelocation
{
    struct Parts
    {
        uint16_t pageRelativeOffset : 12;
        uint16_t isCall : 1;
        uint16_t rexWPrefix : 1;
        uint16_t cfgCheck : 1;
        uint16_t reserved : 1;
    };
    
    Parts asParts;
    uint16_t asNumber;
};
```
    
PageRelativeOffset has the same role as above. Apart from that, additional parameters used:
* `isCall` - differentiate between call and jump instruction,
* `cfgCheck` - this value will be `1` if the call/jump is to the config check (which will be in a
format of the call to the pointer) or indirect call to value from `rax` register. This matters when
choosing which retpoline to use for such cases - offset in retpoline page will be `0x2A0` for
`cfgCheck == 1` and `0x2E0` for `cfgCheck == 0`,
* `rexWPrefix` - we never encountered this flag to be set yet, so this is a field for the next blog
entry :)

For example, for case with `cfgCheck == 1` and `isCall == 1` original code
```
ff15xxxxxxxx    call qword ptr ds:[<cfgCheckAddressPtr>]
```
will be replaced by
```
e8xxxxxxxx    call <address of the retpoline_page + 0x2A0>
90            nop
```

Similarly for case with with `cfgCheck == 0` and `isCall == 0` original code
```
ffe0    jmp rax    
```
will be replaced with
```
e9xxxxxxxx    jmp <address of the retpoline_page + 0x2E0>
90            nop
```

## Type 3 retpoline:
Structure:
```
union ImageImportControlTransferDynamicRelocation
{
    struct Parts
    {
        uint32_t pageRelativeOffset : 12;
        uint32_t isCall : 1;
        uint32_t iatIndex : 19;
    };
    Parts asParts;
    uint32_t asNumber;
};
```

This type is dedicated to the calls or jumps to the imported functions. Original code
```
48ff15xxxxxxxx    call qword ptr ds:[<imported function address ptr>]
0f1f440000        nop dword ptr ds:[rax+rax*1], eax
```
will be replaced by
```
4c8b15xxxxxxxx    mov r10, qword ptr ds:[<imported function address ptr>]
e8xxxxxxxx        call <address of the retpoline page + 0x420>
```

Since code of retpoline is unchangeable, the imported function address will be first moved to `r10`, from
which the indirect call will be performed in the retpoline code. The exact retpoline address offset in this
case is `0x420`. 

Similarly, for the jump instruction, the original code
```
48ff25xxxxxxxx    jmp qword ptr ds:[<imported function address ptr>]
cccccccccc        int3
```
will be replaced by
```
4c8b15xxxxxxxx    mov r10, qword ptr ds:[<imported function address ptr>]
e9xxxxxxxx        jmp <address of the retpoline page + 0x420>
```

In some cases, when import optimization feature is enabled, instead of jumping to the retpoline, the
instruction can be replaced by jump directly to the imported function module. Import optimization (or
import linking) is another feature that can address the Spectre v2 problem without using retpoline when
certain conditions are met. It is also controllable under the registry flag
```
0x2000000 - FEATURE_SETTINGS_DISABLE_IMPORT_LINKING
```

For the cases similar to retpoline type 3, the indirect branch targeting imported function may be
replaced by calling the target directly. For this to happen, the following conditions need to be met: the
address has to be relatively close (less than 2 GB), the feature is on and the content of the IAT (import
access table) will not change after the image is loaded. This feature is used along with retpoline and can
give a significant boost to OS performance.

## Conclusion
Anti-Cheat software has to discriminate between benign and illicit modifications of the game's code. 
The operating system has always made some benign changes to apply base relocation, and to store 
import function addresses in the import address table. With the advent of side-channel mitigations, the 
Windows kernel now patches more places to redirect calls and jumps to a retpoline section to mitigate 
Spectre v2. DVRT is the structure stored in the `.reloc` section that describes these patch locations.
We have dissected and documented these novel data structures.
